The ncdfCF package provides an easy to use interface to NetCDF resources in R, 
either in local files or remotely on a THREDDS server.

It is built on the RNetCDF package which provides a basic interface to the
NetCDF library, but which lacks an intuitive user experience. Package ncdfCF on
the other hand provides a high-level interface using functions and methods that
are familiar to the R user.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ncdfCF from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pvanlaake/ncdfCF")
```

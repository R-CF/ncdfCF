# Changelog

## ncdfCF (development version)

##### API

- When selecting auxiliary coordinates on an axis, printing a
  `CFVariable` using that axis will print the name of the active
  coordinates for that axis and its units, if set.

##### Code

- Fixed NC_CHAR label/axis dimensions.

## ncdfCF 0.8.1

CRAN release: 2026-02-02

Patch release with bug fixes and some new functionality.

##### API

- New
  [`geom_ncdf()`](https://r-cf.github.io/ncdfCF/reference/geom_ncdf.md)
  function to create a `geom` for use in map composition using package
  `ggplot2`. Functionality is currently limited and only basically
  tested.
- In `CFVariable$subset()` subsetting a “time” axis can now use
  abbreviated specification such as `time = "2025-12"` to select all
  data for December 2025, or `time = c("2020-S1", "2025-S4")` for all
  meteorological season data from 2019-12-01 to 2025-11-30 (inclusive).
  Abbreviation can be by year, month, meteorological season (S1 to S4),
  quarter (Q1 to Q4) or dekad (D01 to D36).

##### Code

- Fixed writing attributes for groups.
- Fixed reading of scalar variables following subsetting of a scalar
  axis.
- Documentation updates.

## ncdfCF 0.8.0

CRAN release: 2026-01-23

##### Conventions

- Ancillary variables are now associated with the data variables that
  reference them. They can be added with the
  `CFVariable::add_ancillary_variable()` method and the list of
  registered ancillary variables can be retrieved with the
  `CFVariable$ancillary_variables` field. Ancillary variables are
  `CFVariable` instances themselves and can have bounds and other data
  variable properties, and be processed like regular data variables.
- Vertical parametric coordinate “Atmosphere hybrid sigma pressure
  coordinate” added. This supports both the layer mid-point formulation
  of CF and the layer top and bottom formulation often found in
  satellite observations of the atmosphere.

##### API

- `CFGroup` is now the main hierarchy from the user perspective,
  maintaining all CF objects. The `CFGroup$add_variable()` method places
  a `CFVariable` somewhere in the hierarchy, with owned CF objects (like
  axes, boundary values, CRS, etc) automatically attached to the same
  group or some other specified group.
- All `[]` indexing and selection operations must include axes of
  length 1. This means that the indexing always has as many elements as
  there are axes in the CF variable. Reported dimensions include
  degenerate dimensions.
- The `CFVariable::subset()` method now has an optional `.resolution`
  argument that can be specified when interpolation with auxiliary
  latitude-longitude coordinates is requested; otherwise it has no
  effect. This change does not break any existing code.
- In `CFVariable$subset()` and `$profile()`, when selecting on auxiliary
  grid axes then both axes must be specified.
- Function
  [`create_ncdf()`](https://r-cf.github.io/ncdfCF/reference/create_ncdf.md)
  creates a new netCDF resource on disk, as a container for persisting
  CF objects, or in memory.
- Function [`as_CF()`](https://r-cf.github.io/ncdfCF/reference/as_CF.md)
  can now also convert a
  [`terra::SpatRaster`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/SpatRaster-class.html)
  to a `CFDataset` or a `CFVariable`, depending on the number of
  variables in the `SpatRaster`. This is a fragile process, mostly due
  to `terra` idiosyncrasies related to multi-dimensional data.
- Documentation updated, now available online.

##### Code

- Access to data values is now consistently using the public field
  `values` for “standard” objects. Only objects that require special
  values management use private fields and expose the data values in
  another, more appropriate form.
- `CFGroup` hierarchy maintains all CF objects. 1:1 alignment with the
  `NCGroup` hierarchy for NC objects backed by a netCDF resource.
- `CFData` class spawned from `CFObject` to act as a base class for CF
  objects that hold data, most notably `CFVariable`, `CFAxis` and
  `CFBounds` and descendant classes. The class manages the “shape” of
  the data, including degenerate dimensions, to maintain consistency
  with the owning object, principally the axes in a `CFVariable`
  instance.
- Stricter checking of data types versus netCDF types.
- Attributes are now considered when testing for axis equality.
- Support some edge cases in reading marginally-CF netCDF files,
  including lateral search.
- `CFVariable` S3 methods fixed.
- Multi-dimensional auxiliary lat-long grids are silently truncated to
  2D.
- Improved speed of opening netCDF files with multiple data variables
  using the same auxiliary long-lat grid.
- `CFResource` has been renamed `NCResource`.
- Additional testing added.
- Bug fixes.

## ncdfCF 0.7.0

CRAN release: 2025-09-13

This is a major restructuring of the code logic to better separate
between file-based netCDF objects and in-memory CF objects.
Additionally, there are important additions to the user-facing API, in
particular with regards to arithmetic, math and logical expressions on
CF objects.

##### Conventions

- `CFAxisVertical` can now calculate parametric coordinates for two
  ocean formulations (other formulations will be added as sample data
  becomes available to test new code on - open an
  [issue](https://github.com/R-CF/ncdfCF/issues) if you have such data
  and are looking for support). Optional use of the `units` package to
  deal with the various pressure units. This package is recommended if
  you work with data on the atmosphere or the ocean.
- Boundary variables can have attributes.
- The standard names table of the CF Metadata Conventions is now
  accessible. The table is automatically downloaded and made available
  when first used; it will not be downloaded or loaded into memory when
  not accessed. Find standard names using the `CF$standard_names$find()`
  method. The table (currently 4.3MB) will be stored in the local cache
  of the ncdfCF package and periodically updated with the latest
  version.

##### API

- The `CFArray` class has been merged with `CFVariable`. This makes for
  more concise code and easier combination of multiple operations on a
  single netCDF resource. All functionality remains.
- With the [`as_CF()`](https://r-cf.github.io/ncdfCF/reference/as_CF.md)
  function you can create a `CFVariable` instance from an R object such
  as a vector, matrix or array using logical, integer, double or
  character mode. Axes are created from dimnames, using names when set
  (such as in `dimnames(arr) <- list(X = 40:43, Y = 50:54, Z = 60:65)`)
  and possibly with latitude, longitude and time axes generated.
- Functions from the Ops and Math groups of S3 generic functions are now
  supported. This means that expressions can be written directly on
  `CFVariable` instances.
- All `CFAxis` descendant classes now have a
  [`copy()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/data.table/man/copy.html) method which
  creates a deep copy of the axis and a `copy_with_values()` method that
  makes a copy of the current axis but with new values.
- All CF objects that derive from a CF object read from file have access
  to the file as long as the data is not modified. Thus in statement
  `axisB <- axisA$copy()`, the new `axisB` instance will have file
  access (assuming that `axisA` has it too). Same with
  `CFVariable$$subset()` and `$profile()`. `CFVariable$summarise()` does
  not retain access because the array values are modified. Math and Ops
  function results likewise do not retain file access.
- New `CFAxis$coordinate_range` field to retrieve the range of the
  coordinates of the axis.
- Names of CF objects (variables, axes, etc) can be modified. Strict
  checking of allowable names (i.e. only letters, numbers and
  underscores).

##### Code

- Dependency on R bumped from version 3.5 to 4.0.
- Axis names in new groups are ensured to be unique after subsetting,
  profiling, etc.
- Fully-qualified names of groups generated on-the-fly.
- Correctly link multiple cell measure variables.
- Write labels for data variables to file.
- Disentangling CF objects from the NC hierarchy. The NC hierarchy
  represents what is on file, the CF objects are mutable. Attributes are
  now managed in `CFObject`, those in `NCObject` are read from file and
  immutable.
- Class `CFVariable` has absorbed classes `CFArray` and
  `CFVariableBase`.
- Several minor improvements and code fixes.
- Documentation updated.

## ncdfCF 0.6.1

CRAN release: 2025-06-15

- ncdfCF is now hosted on Github through the R-CF organization: all
  things related to the CF Metadata Conventions in R.
- `CFArray$new()` writes `coordinates` attribute for scalar axes.
- Set boundary values on lat-long grids warped from auxiliary grids.
- Fixed profiling on a “time” axis and writing boundary values to file,
  with regular or “climatology” bounds.
- Fixed subsetting on multiple character labels from a label set.
- Testing added. This is rather bare-bones because the netCDF files that
  are bundled with the package are necessarily small. Much more testing
  is done locally on a large set of production netCDF files.

## ncdfCF 0.6.0

CRAN release: 2025-05-29

- New [`profile()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/profile.html) method for
  `CFVariable` and `CFArray`. With this method profiles can be extracted
  from the data, having a user-selectable dimensionality and location.
  Examples are temporal profiles at a given location or a zonal (lat or
  long) vertical profile of the atmosphere, but there are many other
  options. Multiple profiles can be extracted in a single call and they
  can be generated as a list of `CFArray` instances or as a single
  `data.table`.
- New [`append()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/append.html) method for
  `CFArray`. With this method you can append a `CFArray` instance to
  another `CFArray` instance, along a single, selectable axis with all
  other axes being identical. This is especially useful to append time
  series data spread over multiple files, as is often the case with CMIP
  data. Given the large size of many such files, it is often necessary
  to
  [`subset()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/subset.html)
  the data variable first before appending.
- [`subset()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/subset.html)
  method signature changed to have similar signature as the new
  [`profile()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/profile.html) method.
- `indexOf()` method on axes is using boundary values consistently.
- CFObject and descendants take group field from NCVariable instance.
- Fixed creating a scalar time axis from a longer time axis when doing
  e.g. `CFVariable$subset(time = "2025-04-17")`.
- Scalar axes are now implemented as an axis of a specific type with
  length 1.
- Fix label set references when multiple variables share an axis with
  label sets associated with it.
- Minor code fixes.

## ncdfCF 0.5.0

CRAN release: 2025-04-16

- Cell measure variables fully supported. External variables can be
  linked and are then automatically available to referring data
  variables.
- Writing a `CFArray` instance to file automatically orients the data
  into the canonical axis order of X - Y - Z - T - others.
- `CFAxis` has several methods added to work with multiple sets of
  auxiliary coordinates associated with the axis.
- `CFLabel` has [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) and
  [`write()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/write.html) methods.
- `CFVariable::subset()` can subset over a discrete axis with auxiliary
  coordinates.
- `summarise()` can now summarise over eras. This yields a
  climatological statistic which is now supported with the appropriate
  “time” axis description.
- `actual_range` attribute is set on data arrays, axes and bounds.
- Added `CFDataset$var_names` and `CFDataset$axis_names` fields.
- Check for duplicate object names at group level added.
- Axis `values` fields made private. Read-only access provided
  through`CFAxis$values` and `CFAxis$coordinates` (preferred) for
  consistent access patterns throughout the axis class hierarchy.
- Root group can [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) without
  enclosing data set.
- Fixed `summarise()` when temporal result yields scalar time axis.
- Fixed writing bounds for a “time” axis.
- Fixed saving a packed `CFArray` when the original netCDF file was
  packed as well.
- Minor code fixes.
- Documentation updates.

## ncdfCF 0.4.0

CRAN release: 2025-03-11

- `CFData` has been renamed `CFArray` to more accurately describe its
  contents.
- `CFArray` objects can now be written to a netCDF file.
- Methods `CFVariable$summarise()` and `CFArray$summarise()` summarise
  the temporal dimension of a data object to a lower resolution using a
  user-supplied function, using the specific calendar of the temporal
  dimension and returning a new `CFArray` object with the summarised
  data for every return value of a call to the function, i.e. the
  function may have multiple return values. The `CFArray` version is
  much faster (because all data has been read already), but the
  `CFVariable` version can also summarise data variables that are too
  big to fit into the available memory entirely. In either case, code is
  optimized compared to the R base version so an operation over the
  “time” dimension of a data array is about twice as fast as using the
  base R `apply(X, MARGIN, tapply, INDEX, FUN, ...)` call.
- Method `CFArray$data.table()` exports a data object to a `data.table`.
- `CFVariable` and `CFArray` classes now have
  [`time()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/time.html)
  method to retrieve the “time” axis or its `CFTime` instance, if
  present.
- `CFAxis` has new `coordinates` field with which to retrieve the
  coordinates along the axis.
- New attributes can be defined on any object that supports attributes,
  or deleted.
- Fixed error on reading bounds for auxiliary coordinate variables.
  Various other minor code fixes.
- `NCResource` fixed to conform to new `R6` version.
- Documentation updated, including vignettes.

## ncdfCF 0.3.0

CRAN release: 2025-01-19

- Function
  [`peek_ncdf()`](https://r-cf.github.io/ncdfCF/reference/peek_ncdf.md)
  returns quick-view information on a netCDF resource.
- String-valued labels for discrete and generic numeric axes are now
  supported, including multiple label sets per axis. The labels are
  associated with an axis rather than a data variable (as the CF
  documents imply) and the axis must be explicitly defined (as the CF
  documents imply but not explicitly state, and it is missing from the
  example given).
- Functions `makeMemoryGroup()`,
  [`makeLongitudeAxis()`](https://r-cf.github.io/ncdfCF/reference/makeLongitudeAxis.md)
  and
  [`makeLatitudeAxis()`](https://r-cf.github.io/ncdfCF/reference/makeLatitudeAxis.md)
  added to create scaffolding for new CF objects.
- `NCGroup::unused()` method identifies unused `NCVariable`s to aid in
  finding issues with netCDF resources.
- [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method for `NCVariable`
  and `NCDimension`.
- Method `CFObject$fullname` added, giving fully-qualified CF object
  name.
- “Axis” associated with bounds variable is no longer created.
- NASA level-3 binned data (L3b) is now supported.
- Reference to a containing `NCGroup` moved down to `CFObject` for CF
  objects.
- Minor code fixes.
- Documentation extended and formatting fixed, new vignette.

## ncdfCF 0.2.1

CRAN release: 2024-10-14

- NetCDF groups are now fully supported, including traversing group
  hierarchies with absolute or relative paths.
- All axis types are identified correctly. This includes:
  - Regular coordinate axes (a.k.a. NUG coordinate variables).
  - Discrete axes, even when no coordinate variable is present - an
    extension to the CF conventions.
  - Parametric vertical axes, but values are not yet computed.
  - Scalar axes, linked to variables through the “coordinates” attribute
    of the latter.
  - Auxiliary longitude-latitude grids, the horizontal component of the
    grid of a variable that was not defined as a Cartesian product of
    latitude and longitude, using the “coordinates” attribute of the
    variable. When subsetting a data variable, resampling is
    automatically performed.
- The four axes that *“receive special treatment”* by the Conventions
  each have a separate class to deal with their specific nature:
  CFAxisLongitude, CFAxisLatitude, CFAxisVertical, and CFAxisTime.
- Bounds are read and interpreted on all axes except the vertical axis,
  including any auxiliary long-lat grids.
- Information on UDTs is captured in a separate class. This is
  effectively only supported for the “compound” sub-type, for scalar
  values only.
- Data is read into the most compact form possible. This saves a
  significant amount of memory when large integer variables are read as
  they would remain integers rather than the default numeric type.
- Data is returned from `CFVariable$subset()` as an instance of the
  `CFData` class, with associated objects such as axes and the
  attributes from the variable. Data can be read out in a variety of
  forms, currently as a raw array, an oriented array or as a
  [`terra::SpatRaster`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/SpatRaster-class.html)
  or
  [`terra::SpatRasterDataset`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/SpatRaster-class.html).
- Full support for grid mapping variables. As a significant extension
  over CF Metadata requirements, CRS strings are produced in the OGC
  WKT2 format, using the latest EPSG database of geodetic objects.
- Improvements in printing object details.
- Code refactored to R6.
- GHA enabled

## ncdfCF 0.1.1

CRAN release: 2024-06-10

- `objects_by_standard_name()` will list objects in the netCDF resource
  that have a “standard_name” attribute.

## ncdfCF 0.1.0

- Initial CRAN submission. This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and the package is
  not yet fit for a production environment.
- This version supports reading from netCDF resources. CF Metadata
  Conventions are used to set properties on axis orientation, time
  dimensions and bounds.
- Standard R commands can be used to inspect properties of the netCDF
  resource, such as
  [`dimnames()`](https://r-cf.github.io/ncdfCF/reference/dimnames.md)
  and [`length()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/length.html).
- Access to data uses the R standard `[` selection operator for use with
  dimension indices. Use real-world coordinates with
  [`subset()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/subset.html).

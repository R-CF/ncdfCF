Description: NetCDF files are widely used for scientific data. Low-level access
    in R is provided through packages RNetCDF or ncdf4. Package ncdfCF is built
    on top of RNetCDF and makes the data and its attributes available as a set 
    of S4 classes that are informed by the CF Metadata Conventions. Access to 
    the data uses standard R subsetting operators and common function forms.
